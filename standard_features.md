# General

- The program should follow the XDG Base Directory specification for file locations

## Configuration files

- If no configuration file is specified at the command line, look in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` 
- Use Pydantic Settings Management for program configuration. 
    - Documentation is available here: `https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/pydantic_settings/`

## Command Line Options

- The program should have a "--log-level" command line option that sets the logging level. Default to "WARN".
- The program should have a "--verbose" command line option that enables logging to the console. This should default to "False". If it is enabled show logs at the logging level set with "--log-level"
- The program should have a "--show-config" command line option that loads the configuration file (providing defaults for unspecified values), prints the configuration information to stdout in JSON format, and exits.
- The program should have a "--version" command that prints the current version of the program to stdout and exits. This command should also respect the "--format" specifier.
- The program should have a "--format" command line option that allows the user to select an output format. Typical values are: text, markdown, JSON, YAML

## Logging

- The program should log to file by default. Log files should be located in the `$XDG_STATE_HOME` directory
