To evaluate a problem and decompose it into a series of state machines, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Clearly define the problem statement and objectives.
   - Identify the inputs, outputs, and constraints of the system.

2. **Identify States:**
   - Break down the problem into distinct states. A state represents a specific condition or situation in the system.
   - Determine the initial state and possible end states.

3. **Define Transitions:**
   - Identify events or conditions that cause transitions between states.
   - For each state, list possible transitions and the events that trigger them.

4. **Model State Machines:**
   - Create a state diagram for each state machine, showing states as nodes and transitions as directed edges.
   - Ensure that each state machine is deterministic, meaning that for each state and event, there is a clear next state.

5. **Decompose into Multiple State Machines:**
   - If the problem is complex, decompose it into smaller, manageable state machines.
   - Ensure that each state machine handles a specific aspect of the problem.

6. **Define Actions:**
   - Specify actions or outputs that occur during transitions or while in a particular state.
   - Ensure actions are clearly associated with specific transitions or states.

7. **Validate the Model:**
   - Review the state machines to ensure they cover all possible scenarios and edge cases.
   - Simulate the state machines to verify their behavior against expected outcomes.

8. **Implement in Software:**
   - Translate the state machines into code, using appropriate data structures and control flow.
   - Use libraries or frameworks that support state machine implementation if available.

9. **Test and Iterate:**
   - Test the implemented state machines thoroughly.
   - Iterate on the design and implementation based on test results and feedback.

By following these steps, you can systematically decompose a problem into state machines that can be effectively implemented in software.
