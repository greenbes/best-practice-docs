# Typescript development conventions and best practices

This file contains guidelines for TypeScript that align with principles of modular design and testability. 

Type System Usage
- Prefer explicit type annotations for function parameters and return types to improve readability and catch errors early: `function processUser(user: User): Result<ProcessedUser>`
- Use interfaces for complex objects rather than type aliases when you expect extension or implementation, as interfaces are more flexible for future changes
- Leverage union types and discriminated unions for handling variations in data structures: `type Result<T> = { status: 'success', data: T } | { status: 'error', error: Error }`

Project Structure
- Organize code by feature/domain rather than by type (avoid having separate folders for interfaces, services, etc.)
- Keep related files close together, including tests, interfaces, and implementations
- Use barrel files (index.ts) judiciously to expose public APIs while hiding implementation details
- Maintain clear boundaries between layers (e.g., domain logic, infrastructure, presentation)

Error Handling
- Create custom error types that extend Error for domain-specific errors
- Use Result types instead of throwing errors for expected failure cases
- Implement consistent error handling patterns across the application
- Leverage TypeScript's type system to ensure errors are handled appropriately

Testing
- Write tests alongside source code in `__tests__` directories or with `.test.ts` suffix
- Use dependency injection to make services testable
- Implement strong typing for test doubles and mocks
- Create test utilities that preserve type safety

Dependency Management
- Use dependency injection to maintain loose coupling between modules
- Leverage TypeScript's module system for clear dependency boundaries
- Keep circular dependencies in check through careful architecture design
- Consider using a DI container for larger applications

Generics and Advanced Types
- Use generics to create reusable, type-safe components and functions
- Implement utility types for common operations: `type Nullable<T> = T | null`
- Leverage mapped types and conditional types for type transformations
- Document complex type definitions with clear examples

Code Organization
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle at both the module and function level
- Use namespaces sparingly; prefer modules instead
- Implement clear and consistent naming conventions for types, interfaces, and generics
- Keep type definitions close to where they're used unless they're shared across modules

Configuration
- Maintain strict TypeScript compiler options (strict: true)
- Use project references for large codebases to improve build times
- Configure consistent linting rules across the project
- Implement path aliases to avoid deep relative imports

Domain Modeling
- Use TypeScript's type system to model domain concepts accurately
- Create meaningful type aliases for primitive types when they represent domain concepts: `type UserId = string`
- Leverage literal types and const assertions for value objects
- Use readonly modifiers for immutable data structures

Documentation
- Write TSDoc comments for public APIs and complex functions
- Include examples in documentation for non-obvious type usage
- Document architectural decisions and patterns in a central location
- Maintain up-to-date documentation for type definitions and interfaces
- Function Documentation: Describe what the function does, its parameters, and its return type.
- Class Documentation: Provide an overview of the class, its properties, and methods.
- Type Annotations: Use TSDoc syntax to specify types clearly, enhancing type safety and readability.

Performance Considerations
- Use interface merging judiciously to avoid unnecessary type complexity
- Be mindful of type inference performance in complex generic types
- Consider type-level computation impact on compilation times
- Use type assertions sparingly and document when they're necessary

These guidelines emphasize maintainability, type safety, and clean architecture while keeping the codebase modular and testable. Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect?

Modules
- Prefer ECMAScript ES Modules
