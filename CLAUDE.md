# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository is a collection of best practice documentation for software development across various technologies, programming languages, and processes. It serves as a reference guide and knowledge base for standardized approaches to ensure consistency and quality in software projects.

**IMPORTANT**: This repository contains ONLY documentation, not code. Tasks primarily involve reviewing, critiquing, and revising documentation.

## Repository Organization

The repository is organized into several key directories:

- `engineering/`: Best practices and conventions for various programming languages and tools
- `software-development-process/`: Templates and guidance for documentation artifacts in enterprise software development
- `product-management/`: Templates for product management documentation
- `state-machines/`: Documentation about state machine design principles
- `specifications/`: Technical specifications for various technologies

## Documentation Standards

When reviewing or modifying documentation in this repository, follow these principles:

- Maintain consistent formatting across similar document types
- Ensure technical accuracy of all recommendations
- Keep information well-organized with clear section headers
- Use GitHub-flavored markdown for all documents
- Cross-reference related documents where appropriate

## Python Best Practices Documentation

The repository contains several important Python best practice documents:

- `engineering/best-practices-python.md`: Core Python coding standards
- `engineering/python-project-layout.md`: Standard Python project structure
- `engineering/evaluation-framework-python.md`: Framework for evaluating Python code quality

Key recommendations include:

- Use src-layout pattern for Python projects
- Use functional programming style (map, reduce, filter) over comprehensions
- Prefer itertools for iteration
- Follow PEP 8 naming conventions
- Use structlog for logging
- Use pydantic for data models
- Use uv for package management

## Documentation Review Process

When asked to review or critique documentation:

1. Assess technical accuracy of guidance
2. Check consistency with other related documents
3. Evaluate clarity and organization
4. Suggest improvements for readability and completeness
5. Verify all examples follow best practices

## Working With This Repository

- When adding new documentation, follow existing patterns and standards
- When critiquing documents, provide specific, actionable feedback
- When revising documents, maintain the original intent while improving clarity
- Always check cross-references between documents when making changes

Remember that this repository serves as an authoritative reference for best practices, so all documentation should be held to a high standard of quality and accuracy.
