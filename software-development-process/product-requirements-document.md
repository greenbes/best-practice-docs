# Product Requirements Document – Scope and Detail

A Product Requirements Document (PRD) is a standard part of enterprise software development.

A PRD is comprehensive about the product’s functional scope and objectives while avoiding technical solution specifics. It should clearly articulate:

- The product’s purpose, target users or personas
- Features and functionality to be delivered
- Key constraints or criteria for success
- Non-functional requirements relevant to fintech (e.g., security standards, compliance needs)

A PRD focuses on the “what” and “why,” not the “how.”
