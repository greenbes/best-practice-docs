# Engineering Review of Architecture and Implementation Documentation

Engineers use the architecture document as a foundation for implementation. They look for:

- Clarity and feasibility of design
- Coverage of requirements
- Identification of risks or gaps
- Understanding of interfaces and dependencies

Following review, engineers produce various implementation documents including detailed design specifications, source code documentation, configuration guides, unit tests, and technical test cases.
