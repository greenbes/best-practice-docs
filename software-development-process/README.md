# Documentation Artifacts in Enterprise Software Development

In an enterprise environment, software teams rely on a suite of documentation artifacts to ensure alignment across multiple teams and stakeholders. These documents serve as a shared knowledge base that captures what needs to be built, how it will be built, and how progress and risks are managed. The focus is on fulfilling information needs for various roles (product managers, architects, engineers, testers, managers) without prescribing specific development methodologies.

## Common Documentation Artifacts and Their Audiences

Effective software projects produce several types of documentation, each tailored to different information needs:

### Product Requirements Document (PRD)

- **Purpose**: Captures the product’s intended features, functionalities, and business objectives from an end-user perspective.
- **Content**: Translates high-level business or customer needs into specific requirements such as features, user stories, use cases, and acceptance criteria.
- **Audience**:
    - Product Managers: Communicate vision
    - Designers: Understand features
    - Development Teams & Testers: Know what needs to be built
- The file [product-requirements-document.md](product-requirements-document.md) contains more details.

### Technical Architecture Document (Architecture Specification)

- **Purpose**: Describes how the system will be built to fulfill the PRD.
- **Content**: Outlines high-level design, major components/modules, interactions, key architectural decisions and rationale. Includes diagrams, integration points with external systems, data models, and strategies for security, scalability, and performance.
- **Audience**:
    - Solution/Technical Architect: Provide an overview of the product’s structure
    - Development Team & QA Teams: Reference for detailed design and testing considerations
- The file [technical-architecture-document.md](technical-architecture-document.md) contains more details.

### Implementation Documentation (Technical Design & Code-Level Docs)

- **Purpose**: Describes how the system is actually built, bridging the gap between high-level architecture and code.
- **Content**: Includes technical designs, class designs, algorithms, API endpoint specifications, configuration details, coding standards, in-code comments, developer README files, build/configuration scripts.
- **Audience**:
    - Engineers: Reference guide during development and maintenance

### Quality Assurance Documentation (Test Plans & Cases)

- **Purpose**: Specifies the testing strategy and verification criteria for the product.
- **Content**: Outlines the scope of testing, types to be executed (unit, integration, UAT), quality criteria, schedules, detailed test case specifications.
- **Audience**:
    - QA Engineers & Test Managers: Ensure the product meets defined requirements and quality standards

## Conclusion

Enterprise software development thrives on clarity and shared understanding facilitated by strong documentation practices. Key artifacts like PRDs, technical architecture documents, and implementation-level docs serve distinct purposes for different audiences. Engineers rely on these documents to align their work, while engineering managers and project managers use them to keep projects aligned, manage risks, and coordinate progress across multiple teams. This emphasis on meaningful documentation ensures efficient development, compliance, quality, and transparency in the fintech domain.
