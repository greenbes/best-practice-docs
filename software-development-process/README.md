## Why Documentation Matters

In complex environments, documentation is not just a formality—it is a critical tool for:

- **Aligning teams** on goals, requirements, and technical direction
- **Managing risk** by making decisions and assumptions explicit
- **Facilitating onboarding** and knowledge transfer
- **Supporting compliance** and audit requirements
- **Enabling efficient collaboration** across roles and geographies

## Key Documentation Artifacts

Below are the primary documentation types, their purposes, and audiences. Each artifact links to a detailed template or example.

### 1. Product Requirements Document (PRD)

- **Purpose:** Defines the product’s features, business objectives, and user needs.
- **Content:** Features, user stories, use cases, acceptance criteria, business context.
- **Audience:** Product managers, designers, developers, QA, stakeholders.
- **Reference:** [product-requirements-document.md](product-requirements-document.md)

### 2. Technical Architecture Document

- **Purpose:** Outlines how the system will be built to meet the PRD.
- **Content:** System architecture, major components, data flows, integration points, key decisions, diagrams, scalability/security/performance considerations.
- **Audience:** Architects, developers, QA, DevOps, security teams.
- **Reference:** [technical-architecture-document.md](technical-architecture-document.md)

### 3. Implementation Documentation

- **Purpose:** Bridges high-level architecture and code; details how the system is actually built.
- **Content:** Technical designs, class/module diagrams, API specs, configuration, code standards, developer guides, build scripts.
- **Audience:** Engineers, maintainers, code reviewers.

### 4. Quality Assurance Documentation

- **Purpose:** Defines the testing strategy and verification criteria.
- **Content:** Test plans, test cases, quality criteria, schedules, test data, automation strategy.
- **Audience:** QA engineers, test managers, developers.

### 5. Project Management & Process Documentation

- **Purpose:** Tracks progress, risks, decisions, and process adherence.
- **Content:** Implementation plans, risk registers, meeting notes, status reports, retrospectives.
- **Audience:** Project managers, engineering managers, stakeholders.

## Best Practices

- **Keep documents living:** Update as the project evolves; avoid stale documentation.
- **Tailor depth to audience:** High-level for stakeholders, detailed for implementers.
- **Link related artifacts:** Cross-reference requirements, architecture, and test plans.
- **Automate where possible:** Use tools for generating API docs, diagrams, and changelogs.
- **Review regularly:** Make documentation part of the definition of done.
