# Technical Architecture Document – Scope and Detail

The Technical Architecture Document provides a high-level, technology-agnostic blueprint of the software’s design. At this stage, the focus is on architectural patterns, system structure, and the rationale for key decisions, not on implementation details.

---

## 1. Overview of System Structure

- **Subsystems/Modules/Services**: Identify and describe the major building blocks of the system (e.g., API Gateway, Authentication Service, Data Processing Engine, Frontend Web App).
- **Bounded Contexts**: Define clear boundaries for each subsystem, following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles where appropriate.
- **Interaction Patterns**: Specify how components interact (e.g., RESTful APIs, event-driven messaging, synchronous vs. asynchronous communication).
- **Layered Architecture**: Indicate the use of architectural layers (e.g., Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access) and their responsibilities.

---

## 2. Key Architectural Patterns and Decisions

- **Pattern Selection**: Document the architectural patterns chosen for the system, such as:
    - Microservices vs. Monolith
    - Event-Driven Architecture
    - CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
    - Layered (N-tier) Architecture
    - Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
    - Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters) Architecture
    - Client-Server, MVC/MVVM, etc.
- **Rationale**: For each pattern or major decision, explain why it was selected (e.g., scalability, maintainability, team structure, regulatory requirements).
- **Trade-offs**: Summarize the pros and cons considered for each decision.

---

## 3. Mapping Requirements to Architecture

- **Traceability Matrix**: Map high-level product requirements (from the PRD) to architectural components or services responsible for fulfilling them.
- **Responsibility Assignment**: For each major requirement or use case, indicate which subsystem or module is responsible.

---

## 4. Cross-Cutting Concerns and Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability**: Describe how the architecture supports horizontal/vertical scaling (e.g., stateless services, load balancing, partitioning).
- **Reliability & Availability**: Patterns for fault tolerance, redundancy, graceful degradation, and disaster recovery.
- **Security**: High-level approach to authentication, authorization, data protection, and compliance (e.g., OAuth2, RBAC, encryption at rest/in transit).
- **Observability**: Logging, monitoring, tracing, and alerting patterns to ensure system health and traceability.
- **Performance**: Caching strategies, asynchronous processing, and other patterns to meet performance goals.
- **Extensibility & Maintainability**: Use of modular design, clear interfaces, and separation of concerns to facilitate future changes.

---

## 5. Infrastructure and Deployment Architecture

- **Deployment Topology**: High-level diagrams and descriptions of how components are deployed (e.g., cloud-native, on-premises, hybrid).
- **Environment Strategy**: Approach to managing environments (dev, staging, production) and configuration.
- **CI/CD Patterns**: Overview of continuous integration and deployment strategies (e.g., blue/green deployments, canary releases).
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Identify external systems and integration patterns (e.g., API contracts, message brokers, data pipelines).

---

## 6. Architectural Diagrams

- **Component Diagram**: Visualize the main components and their relationships.
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Illustrate key flows or interactions between components for critical use cases.
- **Deployment Diagram**: Show how components are mapped to infrastructure.

---

## 7. Architectural Principles and Constraints

- **Guiding Principles**: State the core principles to be followed (e.g., "APIs must be versioned", "All services must be stateless", "Sensitive data must be encrypted").
- **Constraints**: List any architectural constraints (e.g., must use a specific cloud provider, must comply with certain standards).

---

## 8. Open Architectural Questions

- **Unresolved Issues**: Document any areas where further investigation or decisions are needed.
- **Risks and Mitigations**: Identify architectural risks and proposed mitigation strategies.

---

By focusing on these architectural patterns and principles, this document provides a foundation for detailed technical design and implementation, ensuring that the system is robust, scalable, and aligned with business goals.
