# Project Management 

Project Managers coordinate efforts across teams:

1. **Work Breakdown and Task Identification**: Decompose features into concrete tasks for each team.
2. **Mapping Dependencies and Coordinating Plans**: Identify inter-team dependencies and align schedules.
3. **Task Tracking and Tools**: Use project management tools to track day-to-day task status.
4. **Maintaining Alignment and Adaptation**: Adjust assignments or priorities to keep the program on track.
5. **Visibility and Reporting**: Provide transparency to stakeholders through integrated status reports.
