# Design Patterns TODO List

## Creational Patterns

- [ ] Abstract Factory: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes
- [ ] Builder: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations
- [ ] Factory Method: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate
- [ ] Prototype: Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying
this prototype
- [ ] Singleton: Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it

## Structural Patterns

- [ ] Adapter: Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect
- [ ] Bridge: Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently
- [ ] Composite: Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies
- [ ] Decorator: Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically
- [ ] Facade: Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem
- [ ] Flyweight: Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently
- [ ] Proxy: Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it

## Behavioral Patterns

- [ ] Chain of Responsibility: Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a
chance to handle the request
- [ ] Command: Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests
- [ ] Interpreter: Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language
- [ ] Iterator: Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation
- [ ] Mediator: Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact
- [ ] Memento: Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later
- [ ] Observer: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically
- [ ] State: Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class
- [ ] Strategy: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it
- [ ] Template Method: Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure
- [ ] Visitor: Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates
