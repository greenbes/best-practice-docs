# Design Patterns TODO List

## Creational Patterns

- [ ] Abstract Factory: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes
- [ ] Builder: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations
- [ ] Factory Method: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate
- [ ] Prototype: Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying
this prototype
- [ ] Singleton: Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it

## Structural Patterns

- [ ] Adapter: Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect
- [ ] Bridge: Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently
- [ ] Composite: Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies
- [ ] Decorator: Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically
- [ ] Facade: Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem
- [ ] Flyweight: Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently
- [ ] Proxy: Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it

## Behavioral Patterns

- [ ] Chain of Responsibility: Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a
chance to handle the request
- [ ] Command: Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests
- [ ] Interpreter: Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language
- [ ] Iterator: Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation
- [ ] Interpreter: Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language
- [ ] Iterator: Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation
- [ ] Mediator: Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact
