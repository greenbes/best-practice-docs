# File Transfer Pattern

The File Transfer integration pattern outlines how file systems can be used as a means to exchange data between systems. Typically, a producer writes a file to a shared location, and a consumer later retrieves and processes the file. This approach decouples the communicating systems, making it suitable for asynchronous and loosely coupled architectures.
