# File Transfer Pattern

**Overview:**
The File Transfer pattern is a well-established design strategy that facilitates the reliable and efficient exchange of files between disparate systems. It decouples the process of file production and consumption, allowing systems to interact asynchronously and reducing the need for both systems to be online simultaneously. This approach is particularly effective for handling large or bulk file transfers, as it typically incorporates mechanisms for staging, error recovery, and performance optimization. Additionally, implementations of the pattern often involve temporary storage areas, retries, and integration with messaging or queuing systems to ensure data integrity and system resilience.
