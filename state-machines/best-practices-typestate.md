# Best Practices for Using the Typestate Pattern in TypeScript

The typestate pattern is a design pattern that uses the type system to enforce state-specific behavior in your code. It helps catch errors at compile time by ensuring that only valid operations are performed on objects in specific states. Here are some best practices for using the **typestate pattern** in TypeScript, focusing on catching errors at compile time:

---

### **Define Clear States and Transitions**
   - Use **enums** or **literal types** to represent distinct states, which improves readability and maintainability.
   - Define allowed transitions between states explicitly.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     type State = "Draft" | "Submitted" | "Approved" | "Rejected";
     const transitions: Record<State, State[]> = {
       Draft: ["Submitted"],
       Submitted: ["Approved", "Rejected"],
       Approved: [],
       Rejected: [],
     };
     ```
---

### **Use Discriminated Unions for State-Specific Data**
   - Use **discriminated unions** to associate state-specific data with each state. Discriminated unions are a TypeScript feature that allows you to create a union of types with a common property, ensuring that invalid data cannot be accessed in the wrong state.
   - This ensures that invalid data cannot be accessed in the wrong state.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     type Draft = { state: "Draft"; content: string };
     type Submitted = { state: "Submitted"; submissionDate: Date };
     type Approved = { state: "Approved"; approvalDate: Date };
     type Rejected = { state: "Rejected"; reason: string };
     type Document = Draft | Submitted | Approved | Rejected;
     ```
---

### 3. **Enforce State Transitions with Functions**
   - Create functions that enforce valid state transitions, preventing runtime errors. Use TypeScript's **type guards** or **narrowing** to ensure only valid transitions are allowed.
   - Use **type guards** or **narrowing** to ensure only valid transitions are allowed.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     function submitDocument(doc: Draft): Submitted {
       if (doc.state !== "Draft") {
         throw new Error("Only Draft documents can be submitted.");
       }
       return { state: "Submitted", submissionDate: new Date() };
     }
     ```

---

### 4. **Leverage TypeScript's Type System**
   - Use **generics** or **conditional types** to enforce state-specific behavior. For example, conditional types can restrict operations based on the current state.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     function approveDocument(doc: Submitted): Approved {
       if (doc.state !== "Submitted") {
         throw new Error("Only Submitted documents can be approved.");
       }
       return { state: "Approved", approvalDate: new Date() };
     }
     ```

---

### 5. **Catch Errors at Compile Time**
   - Use **strict type checking** to catch invalid state transitions or operations. Enable strict mode in TypeScript for better error detection.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     const draft: Draft = { state: "Draft", content: "..." };
     const approved = approveDocument(draft); // Compile-time error
     ```

---

### 6. **Use Immutability**
   - Ensure state transitions create new objects rather than mutating existing ones. This prevents accidental state changes and makes debugging easier. Consider using immutable data structures or libraries.
   - This prevents accidental state changes and makes debugging easier.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     const submittedDoc = submitDocument(draft); // New object
     ```

---

### 7. **Document State Transitions**
   - Clearly document allowed transitions and state-specific behavior in comments or documentation. Use tools or plugins that generate documentation from code comments to improve code readability and maintainability.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     /**
      * Transitions:
      * - Draft → Submitted
      * - Submitted → Approved | Rejected
      */
     ```

---

### 8. **Test State Transitions**
   - Write unit tests to verify that state transitions work as expected. Use TypeScript's type system to catch errors in tests. For example, test that a function correctly transitions a document from "Draft" to "Submitted".
   - Use TypeScript's type system to catch errors in tests.

By following these best practices, you can leverage the **typestate pattern** effectively in TypeScript and catch errors at compile time, ensuring safer and more predictable code.
