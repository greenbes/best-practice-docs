# Best Practices for Using the Typestate Pattern in TypeScript

Here are some best practices for using the **typestate pattern** in TypeScript, focusing on catching errors at compile time:

---

### 1. **Define Clear States and Transitions**
   - Use **enums** or **literal types** to represent distinct states.
   - Define allowed transitions between states explicitly.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     type State = "Draft" | "Submitted" | "Approved" | "Rejected";
     const transitions: Record<State, State[]> = {
       Draft: ["Submitted"],
       Submitted: ["Approved", "Rejected"],
       Approved: [],
       Rejected: [],
     };
     ```

---

### 2. **Use Discriminated Unions for State-Specific Data**
   - Use **discriminated unions** to associate state-specific data with each state.
   - This ensures that invalid data cannot be accessed in the wrong state.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     type Draft = { state: "Draft"; content: string };
     type Submitted = { state: "Submitted"; submissionDate: Date };
     type Approved = { state: "Approved"; approvalDate: Date };
     type Rejected = { state: "Rejected"; reason: string };
     type Document = Draft | Submitted | Approved | Rejected;
     ```

---

### 3. **Enforce State Transitions with Functions**
   - Create functions that enforce valid state transitions.
   - Use **type guards** or **narrowing** to ensure only valid transitions are allowed.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     function submitDocument(doc: Draft): Submitted {
       if (doc.state !== "Draft") {
         throw new Error("Only Draft documents can be submitted.");
       }
       return { state: "Submitted", submissionDate: new Date() };
     }
     ```

---

### 4. **Leverage TypeScript's Type System**
   - Use **generics** or **conditional types** to enforce state-specific behavior.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     function approveDocument(doc: Submitted): Approved {
       if (doc.state !== "Submitted") {
         throw new Error("Only Submitted documents can be approved.");
       }
       return { state: "Approved", approvalDate: new Date() };
     }
     ```

---

### 5. **Catch Errors at Compile Time**
   - Use **strict type checking** to catch invalid state transitions or operations.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     const draft: Draft = { state: "Draft", content: "..." };
     const approved = approveDocument(draft); // Compile-time error
     ```

---

### 6. **Use Immutability**
   - Ensure state transitions create new objects rather than mutating existing ones.
   - This prevents accidental state changes and makes debugging easier.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     const submittedDoc = submitDocument(draft); // New object
     ```

---

### 7. **Document State Transitions**
   - Clearly document allowed transitions and state-specific behavior in comments or documentation.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     /**
      * Transitions:
      * - Draft → Submitted
      * - Submitted → Approved | Rejected
      */
     ```

---

### 8. **Test State Transitions**
   - Write unit tests to verify that state transitions work as expected.
   - Use TypeScript's type system to catch errors in tests.

---

By following these best practices, you can leverage the **typestate pattern** effectively in TypeScript and catch errors at compile time, ensuring safer and more predictable code.
